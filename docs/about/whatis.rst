What is CodeGrade?
====================

.. deprecation_note:: /

.. include:: codegradefeatures.rst

This is all combined in an online environment that seamlessly integrates in
modern a LMS (e.g. `Canvas <https://www.canvaslms.com/>`_) using the LTI standard. Making
CodeGrade both useful as standalone application and as integration in your
LMS of choice.

.. note:: CodeGrade supports Blackboard, Brightspace, Canvas and Moodle.

CodeGrade Filesystem
----------------------
The CodeGrade Filesystem (or CodeGra.fs) can be used to locally mount a
CodeGrade instance on your computer to browse assignments and files on the
server. The filesystem can also be used by students to locally work on the
CodeGrade mount and thus automatically hand in the assignment with each save.
For teachers the filesystem can be used to grade work without any overhead
locally using a preferred editor.

The CodeGrade filesystem is a unique extension of the online learning environment.

More information on installing and using the CodeGrade filesystem can be found
in this `chapter <https://fs-docs.codegra.de>`__. The Github repository of the Filesystem can be
found on https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.fs. More
information on getting started with the CodeGrade Filesystem at your institute can be found on
`CodeGrade <https://codegrade.com>`_.

CodeGrade Editor Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Accompanying the CodeGrade filesystem are the editor plugins. These plugins
allow for easy and intuitive grading of work locally in your favourite editor.
By using the combination of the filesystem and an editor plugin, overhead during
grading can be reduced to a bare minimum and all focus can be on the actual
grading of the work.

As of writing, there are editor plugins for the following editors:

* Vim (*CodeGra.vim*)
* Atom (*CodeGra.atom*)
* Emacs (*CodeGra.el*)
