Snippets allow you to easily re-use inline feedback messages when grading in
CodeGrade. Follow the guide below to learn how to create, manage and use
snippets.

Snippets in CodeGrade are both available on a course-wide level and a personal
level. Personal snippets are linked to your CodeGrade account and are available
to you for any assignment from any course you grade. Course-wide snippets are
specific to a course and can only be used when grading assignments in that
course, these are however shared by all graders grading in the course.

.. note::

    Course snippets can be set up by anyone with the **Manage course snippets**
    permission, this is enabled for **Teacher** roles only by default.
