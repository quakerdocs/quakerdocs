Divide submissions over graders
==================================

.. deprecation_note:: /for-teachers/grading-in-codegrade/dividing-submissions-over-graders

CodeGrade offers multiple tools to divide submissions over the graders in your
course. Graders can be divided manually or randomly. Additionally, divisions
(both manual or random) can be reused over multiple assignments.

Dividing submissions over your graders has multiple advantages. In addition to
having a clear way to communicate with your graders, it also allows your graders
to easily filter the submission-lists on the CodeGrade website and in the
Filesystem to only show their submissions to grade.

Manually dividing submissions
------------------------------

1. Navigate to the **"Submission list"** of an assignment, by simply clicking on the name of the assignment.

2. If available, uncheck the **"Assigned to me"** filter to display a list of all submissions.

3. It is now possible to manually divide the submissions by using the dropdown in the **"Assigned to"** column. This dropdown shows all graders available in this course.

4. Click any grader in this list to assign the submission to this grader.

Randomly dividing submissions
------------------------------

1. Go to the **Assignment Management** page for the assignment you want to do divide the submissions for by clicking on the :fa:`cog` button.

2. Navigate to the **"Graders"** tab to find the grading dashboard with a list of all graders available in this assignment.

3. Select the graders you want to divide the submissions over in the **"Divide Submissions"** section, optionally adjust the weight or percentages of the graders.

4. Press the **"Divide"** button to the divide the submissions over the selected graders in respect to the given weights.

Connecting divisions between assignments
-----------------------------------------

It is possible to re-use both manual and random divisions in other assignments.
For instance if you require the same graders to grade the same students /
submissions for all assignments. Once you have divided the submissions on one
assignment following either of the above methods, you can follow the steps
below to connect this division to other assignments too:

1. Go to the **Assignment Management** page for the assignment you want to connect to the division of a previous assignment by clicking on the :fa:`cog` button.

2. Navigate to the **"Graders"** tab to find the grading dashboard with a list of all graders available in this assignment.

3. In the **"Divide Submissions"** section, use the **"Connect divisions to"** dropdown to select the assignment you want to connect the divisions to.

.. warning::

    Changing divisions in an assignment that is connected to a previously divided
    assignment will not change the division for the previous assignment **or**
    for other assignments connected to this previous assignment.
