I cannot find a feature in CodeGrade
====================================

.. deprecation_note:: /for-teachers/getting-started

CodeGrade has an elaborate permission system on course level. With this
permission system, course administrators can allow or disallow users to see
specific features or execute specific actions within CodeGrade.

Because of this, it can be possible that a specific feature or action is
unreachable on your CodeGrade account. Please consult your course administrator
to allow the certain action on your account.

.. warning::

    If CodeGrade releases new features in the course of your course that bring
    new permissions, these permissions are automatically disabled on all
    roles (and thus accounts) for security reasons. Please carefully add these
    permissions to the corresponding roles to be able to use them.
