Using shortcuts
======================================================

.. deprecation_note:: /for-teachers/grading-in-codegrade/using-shortcuts-while-grading

For maximum efficiency CodeGrade has support for shortcuts. In most input fields
in CodeGrade you can save using :kbd:`Ctrl+Enter`. For example, after writing an
inline feedback comment, you can press :kbd:`Ctrl+Enter` to save your feedback quickly.
With :kbd:`Tab`, you can cycle through options and go to next input fields.

- :kbd:`Ctrl+Enter`: Saving an input field.

- :kbd:`Tab`: Cycle through options (e.g. snippets) and going to next input fields.
