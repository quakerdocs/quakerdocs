==================================

.. deprecation_note:: /for-teachers/grading-in-codegrade/using-the-filesystem/installing-the-filesystem

The CodeGrade Filesystem is a unique way to mount your CodeGrade instance
locally on your system. This provides the teacher much flexibility by allowing
to test, review and grade work from students locally, in your favourite editor
and using all required tools.

The CodeGrade Filesystem is available for Windows, MacOS and Debian/Ubuntu.
Installing the CodeGrade Filesystem is very straightforward by using our
supplied installer or installer script. This will install
the CodeGrade Filesystem and all required software to successfully run it.

1. Download the latest CodeGrade Filesystem installer for your operating system from https://codegrade.com/filesystem/.

2. Open the installer (or run the installer script) and follow the instructions to install CodeGrade Filesystem.

.. note:: MacOS possibly raises a security error when opening the installer. To still open the installer, navigate to *System Preferences* to the tab *Security & Privacy*. Press the *Open Anyway* button to open the installer anyway, this is not a security risk.

3. After installing, the CodeGrade Filesystem can be opened and used to mount your CodeGrade instance to your computer.
