QuakerDocs - Documentation
===========================

Welcome to the documentation of QuakerDocs!

QuakerDocs is a modern and reliable static documentation generator.
It was designed from the ground up to replace older documentation generators.

Some of the features that QuakerDocs has are:

- Fast generation of a static website
- Write documentation using reStructuredText
- Super-fast live search
- Handy bookmarking system
- Easily configurable
- Only takes one command!
