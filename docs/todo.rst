The following items still have to be added to the documentation of QuakerDocs:

- Available configuration options and how to use them
- Parameters for running the quaker script/executable
- Fix code-blocks in getting-started.rst containing non-existant commands (like quaker)
- Customization (themes, extensions) guide
  - https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/ (Bulma themes)
