Exam mode
=========

.. deprecation_note:: /user-reference/assignments/exam-mode

With CodeGrade's exam mode you can automate when an assignment is visible to
students and send an email to students with a link to the assignment, with
which they can then log in to the assignment. When logged in via such a link
the student will only have access to the course of this exam.

In exam mode all the usual assignment tools are available, such as the rubric
for grading, or the plagiarism checker. You can even set up an AutoTest
configuration to give your students continuous and automated feedback during
the exam.

Exam duration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For exams you do not configure a deadline, but rather a start and a duration.
Set the start by selecting a date and time in the "available at" field. At this
moment the assignment's state will switch from **hidden** to **open**
automatically and students can start submitting their solutions, for the set
duration of the exam.

Student login links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With exam mode enabled it is possible to automatically send an email to the
students of the course that contains a link to the exam. This email is sent
twice, the first time a few days before the exam, and once more half an hour
before the exam starts, so students do not have to search through their email
history to log in to the exam.

Once the exam has started students can click the big "Start" button to start
the exam. They can also choose to log in automatically when the exam starts.
Then they have until the end of the exam to submit their solutions.
