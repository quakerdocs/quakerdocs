         Additionally, clicking on the name of a course results in an overview of its assignments and

          <em>
           General
          </em>
          , you can change the
name of the course. The name may not be empty. As the name of LTI courses is
copied from the LMS, the name of LTI courses cannot be changed within
CodeGrade.
         </p>
         <p>
          On this tab you can also archive a course. Archiving a course will hide it for
students (or more precisely all users that do not have the “See archived
courses” permission), and will sort it below all non archived courses.  You can
still import data from archived courses. Archiving can be reversed without data
loss.
         </p>
         <p>
          The second tab of the course management page,
          <em>
           Members

          , displays a list of all
users (students, teachers and other roles) that are
          <em>
           enrolled
          </em>
          in the
course. The role of users can be changed here and new users can be added to the
course.

delete and can edit the minimum and maximum size of group sets. Group sets are a
key concept for group assignments in CodeGrade, more information about them can

a URL.

          <p>
           Create a new link under the “Members” tab on the “Course Management” page.
Then set both “Expiration date” and “Role” and save your link. The link will
become invalid once the expiration date has passed or when the link is deleted.
When a link is invalid, it is no longer possible to register for the course with
that link.
          </p>
          <p>
           “Role” is the role that is assigned to the users that register via the link.
You can have multiple links with different roles, e.g. one for students to
sign up and one for teachers or TAs to sign up.

            CodeGrade offers two means of handing in for students: via the file uploader

             Setting up your repository to work together with CodeGrade is done with a
             <em>
              deploy key
             </em>
             and
             <em>
              webhook
             </em>
             . The deploy key is used to grant CodeGrade access
to read your repository. The webhook is used to notify CodeGrade for each push
event that takes place. With this setup, students will automatically upload
their work to CodeGrade every time they
             <code class="docutils literal notranslate">
              <span class="pre">
               push

             <p>
              CodeGrade has a size limit on student submissions. Exceeding this size limit
will result in a warning message when regularly handing in, but not when
using git to upload. If a student exceeds this limit, files exceeding the
limit are silently deleted. This very rare case does result in a
              <code class="docutils literal notranslate">

             Uploading via Git works together with CodeGrade’s tools, use it in
combination with Continuous Feedback and AutoTest to provide immediate and
automatic feedback to students every time they submit. It is also possible to
combine Git uploading with group assignments. All students in a group will share
the deploy key and webhook, anyone in the group can hand in for the whole group
with a
             <code class="docutils literal notranslate">
              <span class="pre">
               git

               push
              </span>
             </code>
             . Just like with regular handing in, all group members will
have to open the CodeGrade assignment in their LMS (Canvas, Blackboard,
Brightspace or Moodle).

             In addition to further streamlining the workflow for students, Git uploading
allows teachers to also assess git usage within CodeGrade. This can be done
manually, by looking at the

             folder in the Code Viewer or directly
opening the student repository by clicking the GitLab or GitHub link in the
submission. In AutoTest, the student submission is a normal Git
directory and can be handled and assessed that way automatically.

             The cool off period allows for a more advanced way of limiting the amount of
submissions a student can create. Instead of setting a limit for the entire
assignment, you can set a limit for a certain time frame in an assignment. This
allows you to effectively set an amount of submissions a student may create in a
certain time period.

           <p>
            The hand-in requirements make it possible to set up strict rules to the
structure requested for submissions to a specific assignment. Hand-in
requirements consist of three different parts that specify the behaviour of
your requirements.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, a default policy should be selected:
            <strong>
             by default deny all files
            </strong>
            or
            <strong>
             by default allow all files
            </strong>
            . Exceptions to these rules can be given in the
third part of the specifications.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, numerous options can be selected to further specify the behaviour of
your requirements. These options are:
           </p>
           <ul class="simple">
            <li>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Delete empty directories
              </strong>
              : If enabled, automatically delete empty
directories in submissions.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Delete leading directories
              </strong>
              : If enabled, automatically delete superfluous
leading directories (i.e. top-level directories in which all files
/ subdirectories are located).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Allow overrides by students
              </strong>
              : If enabled, the student can, after being
shown a warning, still force hand in the submission even if it violates the
hand-in requirements.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Thirdly, rules can be given that consist of exceptions to the default rule and
requiring certain files. These rules can apply to files anywhere in the
submission or files that have to be in an given path relative to the top level
directory. These rules are individual and do not have any ordering between them.

             </code>
             as a directory separator to specify that certain files are
required, allowed or denied in a directory. Start the rule with a directory
separator (

the top level directory.

             To match more than one file, you can use a single wildcard for the name of

             . For example
             <code class="docutils literal notranslate">
              <span class="pre">
               /src/*.py

submission.

            To randomly and automatically assign graders to all submissions the Divide
Submission feature on the assignment management page can be used. A list of all
graders is displayed and after selecting the wanted graders weights can be given
to affect the workload per grader. The resulting percentage is the percentage of
submissions the grader will be randomly assigned to. Newly submitted submissions
are automatically assigned to graders after dividing is performed.  Dividing
submissions is consistent, so new submissions will get assigned to the same
teaching assistant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Manually assigning submissions is possible via the submission list, by selecting
the grader using the ‘Assigned to’ dropdown dialog.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also possible to link the divisions and assignees of multiple
assignments. To do this you can select a parent assignment in the selector below
the weights of the graders. When an assignment is connected to another
assignment, the child assignment copies the settings and assignees of the parent
assignment. After linking, the division settings of the parent and the child are
frozen. Multiple assignments can be linked to the same parent, however a parent
cannot be linked to another assignment as a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            When a student submits to a child or parent assignment CodeGrade tries to assign
the student to the same assignee as in other assignments. It does this by first
copying the assignee of the parent assignment for the submitting student, or if
this is not possible selecting the most common assignee in the children
assignments.

            Besides the more traditional discrete categories, CodeGrade also offers
continuous categories. Continuous categories are assigned a maximum amount of
points (which should be higher than 0), and when grading any amount of points
between 0 and the set maximum can be assigned for the category. This allows you,
for example, to split your grade into multiple categories, while still allowing
precise grading. Continuous rubric categories are also very useful for
