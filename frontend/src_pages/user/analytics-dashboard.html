<span id="id1"></span><h1>Analytics Dashboard<a class="headerlink" href="#analytics-dashboard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>CodeGrade’s Analytics Dashboard is built to give you insight in both how
students are doing on an assignment, as well as where an assignment can be
improved to optimize the learning process. You can create selections of all the
submissions for an assignment using filters. These selections are displayed in
parallel in intuitive graphs. There are graphs for when and how many times
students submitted their work, the distribution of grades, and, if the
assignment has a rubric, statistics about the rubric’s categories.</p>
<section id="general-statistics">
<span id="analytics-dashboard-general-statistics"></span><h2>General statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#general-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The general statistics show statistics over all submissions and are not subject
to the selected filters.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Students</strong> or <strong>Groups</strong>: the total number of students (or groups if this
is a group assignment) that submitted their work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submissions</strong>: the total amount of submissions for this assignment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Average grade</strong>: the average grade over the latest submissions of each
student. The latest submission is used here because that is the grade that
a student will get for this assignment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Average submissions</strong>: the average amount of submissions per student.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3">:fa:`info`</span></a> information popovers list some other useful statistics about the
grade:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Mean</strong>: the mean value of the sample.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Std. deviation</strong>: the sample standard deviation from the mean.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Median</strong>: the median value of the sample. This is the middle value in the
sorted list of values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mode</strong>: the mode of the sample. This is the most common value in the
sample.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Since these statistics do not necessarily follow the normal distribution it
is not always the case that ~66% of students lie within 1 standard
deviation from the mean.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="filters">
<h2>Filters<a class="headerlink" href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Filters can be used to select a subset of the available data. You can create
multiple filters to select multiple datasets that will be visualized in
parallel. Each dataset will have its own distinct color in the charts in the
rest of the page. The default filter selects the latest submission of each
student.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is possible to create overlapping datasets, e.g. two datasets that
contain the same submission. This leads to a bias in your data, making it
very difficult to take fair conclusions.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>When an assignment does not have many submissions to begin with, applying
filters will decrease the size even further. Make sure that the amount of
submissions per selection is sufficient to take any conclusion.</p>
</div>
<section id="filter-options">
<h3>Filter options<a class="headerlink" href="#filter-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each filter has a set of options that narrow the scope of its selection.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Latest</strong>: when checked, only the latest submission by each student is
selected. Otherwise all submissions of each student are used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Min. grade</strong>: only select submissions with a grade equal to or greater than
this number.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max. grade</strong>: only select submissions with a grade strictly less than this
number.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submitted after</strong>: only select submissions from this date or after.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submitted before</strong>: only select submissions from strictly before this date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graders</strong>: only select submissions assigned to one of the selected graders.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the bottom of each filter there is a field showing the <a class="reference internal" href="#analytics-dashboard-general-statistics"><span class="std std-ref">general statistics</span></a> for the submissions selected by this
filter.</p>
</section>
<section id="creating-new-filters">
<h3>Creating new filters<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-new-filters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to create a new filter: click <a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">:fa:`plus`</span></a> to add a new
default filter, click <a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">:fa:`copy`</span></a> to duplicate an existing filter, or click
<a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">:fa:`scissors`</span></a> to <a class="reference internal" href="#analytics-dashboard-splitting-filters"><span class="std std-ref">split a filter</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="splitting-filters">
<span id="analytics-dashboard-splitting-filters"></span><h3>Splitting filters<a class="headerlink" href="#splitting-filters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can split the set of submissions selected by a filter into several subsets.
Click the <a href="#id10"><span class="problematic" id="id11">:fa:`scissors`</span></a> button to start splitting a filter.</p>
<p>You are presented with a list of options how you want the set to be split up.
With the exception of the <strong>Latest</strong> option, the submissions are split into
several disjoint subsets.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Latest</strong>: creates two sets of submissions. One will only contain the latest
submission by each student, while the other has all submissions per student,
including their latest submission.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grade</strong>: creates two disjoint subsets. One will contain only those
submissions with a grade strictly lower than the entered value. The other
will contain the rest of the submissions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submitted on</strong>: creates two disjoint subsets, one containing all submissions
that were submitted before the given date, and the other everything that was
submitted after this date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grader</strong>: creates a new subset for each selected grader. The subset per
grader will only contain submissions that are assigned to that grader.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below the splitting options is a field with <a class="reference internal" href="#analytics-dashboard-general-statistics"><span class="std std-ref">general statistics</span></a> for each result that would be
produced by these splits.</p>
<p>Multiple splits can be applied at the same time. The resulting amount of
datasets will be the product of applying each separately.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Splitting on multiple criteria makes the number of resulting filters grow
exponentially in the number of criteria, and making a proper analysis
quickly becomes unwieldy.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Sharing filters</strong></p>
<p>You can click <a href="#id12"><span class="problematic" id="id13">:fa:`share-alt`</span></a> and then <a href="#id14"><span class="problematic" id="id15">:fa:`clipboard`</span></a> to share your current set of
filters with others.</p>

<section id="submission-statistics">
<h2>Submission statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The submission statistics consist of two diagrams.</p>
<p>The first is a histogram that shows, per interval of time, when students have
submitted their work. You can configure the range of dates that should be
visualised, and select a proper bin size.</p>
<p>The second histogram gives insight in how many submissions students have made.
The X-axis lists the amount of submimssions, and the Y-axis lists the number of
students that fall into that category.</p>
</section>
<section id="grade-statistics">
<h2>Grade statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#grade-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The grade statistics shows the distribution of grades. On the X-axis is the
grade and on the Y-axis the number of students that achieved that grade.</p>
</section>
<section id="rubric-statistics">
<h2>Rubric statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#rubric-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The rubric statistics contains several diagrams giving insight in how students
scored on the rubric of this assignment:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Mean (default)</strong> shows the mean score that students achieved per rubric
category. The error bars indicate the standard deviation from the mean.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Median</strong> is the median score per rubric category. The median is obtained by
taking the middle value in the sorted list of scores.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mode</strong> gives the mode per rubric category. The mode is obtained by taking
the most common value amongst a sample.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RIT</strong> is the correlation, commonly denoted <strong>R</strong>, between the <strong>I</strong>tem
and the <strong>T</strong>otal score.  <a class="reference internal" href="#analytics-dashboard-rit-rir"><span class="std std-ref">More details</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RIR</strong> is the correlation <strong>R</strong> between the <strong>I</strong>tem and the <strong>R</strong>educed
score, where the rest score is the total score for the rubric minus the score
for this category. <a class="reference internal" href="#analytics-dashboard-rit-rir"><span class="std std-ref">More details</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Correlation</strong> diagram per rubric category plots the achieved scores in
the rubric category against the <a class="reference internal" href="#analytics-dashboard-reduced-rubric-score"><span class="std std-ref">reduced score</span></a> of the entire rubric. Each point
in the graph represents a single student. <a class="reference internal" href="#analytics-dashboard-correlation-diagrams"><span class="std std-ref">More details</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="reduced-rubric-score">
<span id="analytics-dashboard-reduced-rubric-score"></span><h3>Reduced rubric score<a class="headerlink" href="#reduced-rubric-score" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The reduced rubric score of a rubric category is the total amount of points
achieved for a rubric minus the amount of points achieved for the rubric
category. For example, if a student achieved 10 points in a rubric, of which
2 in the first rubric category, then their reduced rubric score for the first
rubric category is 8.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-rit-rir-values">
<span id="analytics-dashboard-rit-rir"></span><h3>The RIT &amp; RIR values<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rit-rir-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>RIT</strong> and <strong>RIR</strong> values of a rubric category are the correlation
coefficients between the score achieved in one rubric category category versus
how well they did in the overall rubric. Their value is a number between -1 and
1 measuring how well the score in a rubric category predicts the score in the
overall rubric.</p>
<p>Positive values indicate that students who scored higher in a rubric category
also scored higher in the entire rubric, while negative values indicate the
reverse: students who scored higher in this rubric category scored lower on the
overall rubric.</p>
<p>A negative value for a rubric category is an indication that something may be
off with the category and that it may need to be revised. It is not necessarily
the case, of course, so it is left to the discretion of the teacher to act upon
this.</p>
<p>While the RIT and RIR values are very similar, there is a subtle difference in
how they are calculated. The RIT value is calculated against the total score on
the rubric, but since this total score also includes the score for the
compared-to category the data is biased, because higher item scores
automatically lead to higher total scores. The RIR value overcomes this by
using the reduced rubric score instead of the total rubric score. Subtracting
the total score from the item score first, and only then calculating the
correlation between the two removes this bias. The RIR value is often a fairer
representation of the quality of a rubric category.</p>
</section>
<section id="correlation-diagrams">
<span id="analytics-dashboard-correlation-diagrams"></span><h3>Correlation diagrams<a class="headerlink" href="#correlation-diagrams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The correlation diagram of a rubric category has the achieved score in the
category on the X-axis versus the <a class="reference internal" href="#analytics-dashboard-reduced-rubric-score"><span class="std std-ref">reduced rubric score</span></a> on the Y-axis. Each point in the
diagram represents a single student. These diagrams are useful to understand
where the RIR values of the rubric categories came from.</p>
<p>A linear line is drawn through the diagram that best fits the data. This line
reflects the RIR value: if the line is increasing the RIR value for this rubric
category is positive, and if the line is decreasing the RIR value is negative.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="relative-statistics">
<h2>Relative statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#relative-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because it is common to compare datasets of different sizes, all graphs display
their data as percentages of a total, rather than absolute numbers. This
behavior can be toggled with the <a href="#id16"><span class="problematic" id="id17">:fa:`percent`</span></a> button at the top of each chart.</p>
