Notifications
=============

.. deprecation_note:: /user-reference/notifications

You can select to receive email notifications when you receive new feedback on
a submission or a new reply on one of your comments. You can find the
notification settings in the :fa:`user-circle-o` user sidebar by clicking the
:fa:`gear` button under "Notifications".

Here you can configure, per type of event that may generate a notification, if
you want to receive notifications for this type of event, and how often you
want to be updated. The following events may generate a notification:

- **Assignee**: Someone placed a comment on a submission that you are assigned
  to as grader.
- **Author**: You are the author of a submission that someone placed a comment
  on, and thus you may receive a notification.
- **Replied**: When someone replies to a comment or comment thread that you
  have also commented on.

For each event you can select from the following options:

- **Direct**: Send a notification email directly after an event happens.
- **Daily**: Send a daily digest with all notifications that would have been
  sent during the day if the **direct** option would have been selected.
- **Weekly**: Send a weekly digest with all notifications that would have been
  sent during the day if the **direct** option would have been selected.
- **Off**: Never send a notification for this type of event.

.. note:: When you set the **author** event to **direct**, you may not receive
   an email directly when the event is triggered. This can happen, for
   example, when a teaching assistant places some feedback on your submission,
   but you do not have permission to see feedback before the assignment is set
   to "done"; by default students do not have this permission.

Below the notification settings is a list of all notifications you have
received over time. Click on a notification to be taken to the comment that
triggered it.
