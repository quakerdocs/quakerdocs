.. note::

    The guide below assumes CodeGrade has been successfully integrated into
    your Moodle environment as external LTI app.

Creating a new CodeGrade assignment in Moodle will correctly
add this assignment to the corresponding course in CodeGrade, a new course will
automatically be created in CodeGrade if it doesn't exist. Follow
the steps below to create a new CodeGrade assignment in Moodle:

1. Press the **"gear icon"** and select **"Turn editing on"**.

2. Press **"+ Add an activity or resource"**.

3. Press **"External tool"** and press **"Add"**.

4. Set a name, and under the **"Preconfigured tool"** dropdown select **"CodeGrade"**.

5. Set other options you might want, but **do not** set any **"Restrict access"** options.

6. Click **"Save and display"** and the CodeGrade assignment will automatically open.

7. Click the link in the CodeGrade container to **set a deadline/due date** within CodeGrade.

.. warning::

    Never set any **Restrict access** options in Moodle, CodeGrade will
    automatically manage this correctly.

.. note::

    Grades are automatically sent back to Moodle after setting the
    **assignment state** to (:fa:`check`) **Done** in CodeGrade. While the
    assignment is in the (:fa:`check`) **Done** state, all grades and changes to
    grades are immediately sent back to Moodle.

.. note::
    Students can hand in and review their feedback from within the CodeGrade
    container in Moodle.
