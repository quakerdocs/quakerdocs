.. note::

    The guide below assumes CodeGrade has been successfully integrated into
    your Blackboard environment as external LTI app.

Creating a new CodeGrade assignment in Blackboard will correctly
add this assignment to the corresponding course in CodeGrade, a new course will
automatically be created in CodeGrade if it doesn't exist. Follow
the steps below to create a new CodeGrade assignment in Blackboard:

1. Hover over **"Build Content"**.

2. Under **"Create"**, select **"CodeGrade"**.

3. Add a name and optionally a description for your assignment.

4. Set **"Points Possible"** to something greater than 0, e.g. 10.

5. Do **not** set a due date.

6. Click **"Submit"** to create the assignment.

7. Click on the newly created assignment and CodeGrade will open.

8. Click the link in the CodeGrade container to **set a deadline/due date** within CodeGrade.

.. warning::

    Always set **"Points Possible"** to a value greater than 0. Never set a
    **Due Date** in Blackboard, instead manage the due date inside CodeGrade.

.. note::

    Grades are automatically sent back to Blackboard after setting the
    **assignment state** to (:fa:`check`) **Done** in CodeGrade. While the
    assignment is in the (:fa:`check`) **Done** state, all grades and changes to
    grades are immediately sent back to Blackboard.

.. note::
    Students can hand in and review their feedback from within the CodeGrade
    container in Blackboard.
