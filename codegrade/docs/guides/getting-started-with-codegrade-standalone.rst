Getting started with CodeGrade Standalone
--------------------------------------------

.. include:: getting-started-introduction.rst

Standalone
=========================

All functionalities are bundled in one complete environment for programming
education. You will have received a standalone CodeGrade domain with a signup
link from CodeGrade. Either an institution domain, such as
institution.codegra.de or the essential domain: app.codegra.de.

Setting up your course
========================

You also have certain management options in your course. To **manage** the course options
**press “Courses”** (:fa:`book`) in the left sidebar, select your course and press the :fa:`cog`
**icon**. Below is a brief overview of the tabs in course management.

Members
~~~~~~~~

Here you will see all the members in a course and change roles. You can also
add sign up links to your course, to allow students and other members to register
for an account.

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On this page, you can change the permissions of the roles in the course. For
example, you could give your TAs more permissions. Every permission is explained
by the :fa:`info` icon.

.. warning::
    The default permissions will probably suit your course.

Groups
~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use groups, you can create group sets here. A group set can be
used by multiple assignments in the same course.
Depending on permissions you can allow
students to join a group themselves or only allow Teachers or TAs to add students
to a group. If you want to **change** these permissions, you can do so on the
**permissions** page explained above.
:ref:`Click here to learn more about setting up your groups <set-up-group-assignment>`.

Setting up your assignment
=============================

By clicking the :fa:`cog` icon on an assignment you enter the **assignment
management page**. This page allows you to set up **groups**, start
**plagiarism runs**, and add or edit the **rubric**, and set up **automatic
testing**.

General
~~~~~~~~~

On the **“General”** page you can edit several general options. You can also select
a group set to use, if you decide to make an assignment a group assignment.
Furthermore you can set bonus points.

Student Experience
=====================

Students hand in an assignment on the CodeGrade website or optionally via Git. After handing in, students can browse through their
code to check if it is correctly handed in. Before handing in they can
click on the **“rubric”** (:fa:`th`) button to show the rubric for this assignment.
This means students **know what is expected** of them.

After an assignment is set to **“Done”** (:fa:`check`), students can view their feedback  and grade in CodeGrade.

After uploading, a student will find an overview of their **Code** (where they
can browse through their handed in files), an overview of their **Feedback**
and optionally an overview of the **AutoTest** results which can be filled in
preliminarily with Continuous Feedback.
