=======================================================================

1. Go to the **Assignment Management** tab by clicking on the :fa:`cog` icon.
2. Navigate to the **Rubric** tab.
3. Click on the :fa:`plus` icon to create a new rubric.
    .. hint::

        You can also duplicate a rubric from a different assignment. To do this
        click on the :fa:`copy` icon, and use the dropdown list to select the
        assignment to copy the rubric from and press **Submit**.
4. Create a new category by pressing the :fa:`plus` icon at the top.
5. Select a category type, for this example we will use a discrete category.

   Discrete rubric categories are traditional rubric categories. They allow you
   to create multiple levels within a category. While grading you can select the
   level the student achieved.

   Continuous rubric categories allow you to set a maximum amount points, and
   give everything between 0 and the set maximum for that category. These
   categories are especially useful when using
   :ref:`AutoTest <autotest-overview>`.
6. Set a **category name** and **category description**.
7. You can create new levels by clicking on the empty level with a large
   :fa:`plus` in it. For each level set a header, a description, and an amount of
   points.
8. Add as many levels and categories as necessary.

.. warning::

    The **max points** field will be automatically set to the sum of the amount
    of points, CodeGrade will automatically scale this to a grade between 0
    and 10.  **Only change this value if you want to allow bonus points or a
    maximum grade of less than 10**.
