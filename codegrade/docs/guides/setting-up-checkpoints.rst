Setting up Checkpoints
================================

.. deprecation_note:: /for-teachers/creating-automatic-tests/creating-checkpoints

With a checkpoint you can add a condition to your Test Category.

1. Add a Checkpoint.

2. Drag and drop it in the correct location.

3. Specify the minimum percentage of points that needs to be achieved to
   continue the AutoTest Category.

.. note::
  Use a Checkpoint to distinguish between simple and advanced tests, where you
  only want to execute the advanced tests when the simple tests pass.

.. note::
  Use a Run Program Test to compile the code of a student and combine this with
  a Checkpoint after to make sure the rest of the AutoTest Category is only
  executed when compiling is successful.
